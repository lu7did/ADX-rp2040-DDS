# ADX-rp2040-DDS
ADX class FT8 transceiver with direct digital synthesis

This is an experimental project to implement an ADX class digital transceiver
for the HF spectrum based on the rp2040 architecture.

The main characteristic is directly synthesize the modulated output frequency
and the receiver local oscilator out of the rp2040 processor without using 
a Si5351 chip.

Also implements a digital audio interface thru USB instead of the analog
processing.

The project it is in the very preliminary stages, no firm designs nor firmware
is yet available.
